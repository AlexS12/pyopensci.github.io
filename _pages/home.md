## About pyOpenSci

pyOpenSci promotes open and reproducible research through peer-review of
scientific Python packages. We also build technical capacity by providing a
curated repository of high-quality packages and enabling scientists to write
and share their own software. We hope to foster a greater sense of community
among scientific Python users so that we can help each other become better
programmers and researchers.

pyOpenSci is being modeled after the successful [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org/) community.  

## Get Involved

There are many different ways to get involved with pyOpenSci.

1. Join a community meeting: We have monthly meetings that you are welcome to attend.
2. Submit a package to pyOpenSci. We are looking for Python packages that support scientific Python community. Read more about our [review process and scope](https://www.pyopensci.org/dev_guide/peer_review/aims_scope.html)
3. Volunteer to be a reviewer for pyOpenSci. We are looking for people who can help review software packages as they are submitted.
4. Spread the word! Please spread the word about this effort. And look for us this summer at the SciPy meeting in Austin, Texas!
