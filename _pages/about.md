pyOpenSci promotes open and reproducible research through peer-review of
scientific Python packages. We also build technical capacity by providing a
curated repository of high-quality packages and enabling scientists to write
and share their own software. We hope to foster a greater sense of community
among scientific Python users so that we can help each other become better
programmers and researchers.

We draw inspiration from [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org/). If you use `R`, we
encourage you to check them out!
