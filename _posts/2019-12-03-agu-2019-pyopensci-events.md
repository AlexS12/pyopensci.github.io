A group of us will also be leading a <a href="https://www.agu.org/Fall-Meeting/Events/Data-TH33F" target="_blank">town hall dedicated to pyOpenSci: Data FAIR: pyOpenSci: Building a Community Around Open Source Python Software for Science</a>. We expect a strong presence from the rOpenSci community at this event as well! pyOpenSci is being modeled after rOpenSci, but for Python!

I look forward to meeting you at AGU 2019!! Connect with my on twitter if you have questions at AGU! <a href="https://twitter.com/leahawasser" target="_blank">@leahawasser</a>. I will be tweeting during the event!
